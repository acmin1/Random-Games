# Random Number Game Guesser

This app generates a random number between 1 and 100. The player must identify it using clues as to whether their guess is 'too high' or 'too low'. Each game only has 10 attempts before the player loses. The app will record their previous attempts in a table.

After 10 attempts or a correct one, the game is over and must be reset by pressing the reset button at the bottom.
